1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
    1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
        - Others can see the results of the tests you ran.
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
   - No, only unit testing would be necessary.
